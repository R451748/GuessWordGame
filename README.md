Word Guessing Game

The Word Guessing Game is a simple console-based Java application where players try to guess a randomly selected word, one letter at a time, within a limited number of attempts. This project demonstrates the use of basic Java programming concepts, such as object-oriented design, user input handling, and control flow.

Features:
Random Word Selection: A random word is chosen from a predefined list at the start of each game.
Limited Attempts: Players have a fixed number of attempts to guess the word.
Letter-by-Letter Guessing: Players guess the word one letter at a time, with feedback provided after each guess.
Game Progress Display: The game displays the guessed letters and remaining attempts during gameplay.
Win/Loss Tracking: Tracks the number of wins and losses across multiple games.
Replay Option: Players can choose to play multiple rounds.

How It Works
At the start of the game, a random word is selected from a predefined list.
The player is shown the word as underscores (_) representing unguessed letters.
The player guesses one letter at a time.
If the guess is correct, the corresponding underscores are replaced with the guessed letter.
If the guess is incorrect, the number of attempts decreases.
The game continues until:
The player guesses the entire word correctly (Win), or
The player runs out of attempts (Loss).
After each game, the player can choose to play again.
